# Exercise

* Install the package `micro`.

* The `micro` package contains a single mode `counting.py`,
  which contains the single function `count_objects`.

* Run `count_objects` on the data from one of the files in
  the `data/blobs` directory and time its execution.
  The data represents a binary "microscopy" image
  that can be visualized using `maptotlib.pyplot.imshow`.

* Your objective is to count the number of blobs in each image
  in `data/blobs`.
